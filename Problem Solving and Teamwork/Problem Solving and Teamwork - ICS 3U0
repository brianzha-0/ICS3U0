What are the negative effects of computers on the environment and on human health?

(Coordinators): Ranvijay, Yousuf, Brian


Environmental Effects:
Energy Consumption
Data centers, kinds of computers designed to make the storage and transfer of data more efficient, render the degradation and deterioration of hardware & electronics really fast as well. [1]

Total high energy consumption largely contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This means that not only using electronics but also producing them uses/takes energy, in turn upping the carbon footprint of everyone involved who become affected at large. For instance, (s)melting down rare earth metals which are widely used in the technological sector, especially those that are electronics exporters. [7]

To further prove the above point, sustainable smelting fully involves the omission of greenhouse gas emissions via energy production in ways that harm the environment. In contrast, the method is hard to replicate because decarbonising power generation is one of the fastest, if not the most optimal, convention of making energy that is readily available for use. [8]

E-waste
E-waste or electronic waste is the trash product of old or broken computers.

Over a 1,000 different chemicals can build up in landfills and wastelands, causing damage to not only the soil/earth but also the surrounding aquatic and atmospheric/aerial environment. Parts are often unbiodegradable, meaning that components take extremely long periods of time to break down and halt their damage to wildlife, nature, and native locals.

Bioaccumulation refers to the buildup of chemicals and toxins in living things as well as the soil, air, and water. [9]

Human Health Harm:
Eye strain
Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) or digital eye strain refers to issues that one might experience if one uses digital devices for an extended period without taking a break. These devices can include computers , tablets, and phones. [4]

Hours of non-stop screen time can lead to irritation in the eyes, blurry vision and headaches among other symptoms. Two hours of non-stop device use increases chances of getting CVS. There may be more noticeable symptoms if you have dry eyes or eye conditions that cause blurry vision. [4]

Tedonitis
Tendonitis is a condition where the tendons, which are flexible tissues connecting the muscle to bone, become inflamed. Often happens because of overuse or repetitive motion such as (in our context) typing on a keyboard or clicking a mouse. Additionally, poor ergonomics also contributes to tendonitis. For example, sitting in a poor posture, or using a poorly positioned keyboard/mouse. Other risks include: 
Prolonged typing or gaming sessions without breaks.
Using excessive force when typing or clicking.
Poorly designed keyboards, mice, or wrist rests. [5]

It can cause pain, stiffness, swelling and causes disruption in performing daily tasks. Some symptoms for tendonitis in this context can include: 
Pain or tenderness in the hand/wrist, especially near the base of your thumb or fingers.
Swelling or inflammation around the affected tendon.
Stiffness that makes it difficult to move your wrist/hand. 
A clicking sensation in the tendon when moving your wrist or fingers. [5]

Carpal Tunnel 
Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the common hand conditions and it is caused by pressure on the median nerve in the carpal tunnel of the wrist. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway surrounded by bones and ligaments on the palm side of the hand. When the median nerve is compressed, symptoms can include: [6]
Numbness
Tingling
Weakness in the thumb and fingers. [6]

Poor posture/ergonomics
Poor posture is a common problem when using computers for long hours, and it can result in fatigue, muscle strain, and at later stages, back pain. Back pain is one of the more common complaints in slightly older men and women. This type of back pain is most probably the result of years of faulty posture. Poor posture can also affect organ position and functionality of organs in the abdominal region. 


Solutions
What to avoid doing while sitting?
    Tilting the head forward to prevent neck injury
    Sitting without lumbar support to prevent back pain
    Working with arms raised to prevent neck and shoulder pain
    Bending wrists to prevent wrist pain and muscle cramps
    Working with unsupported forearms to prevent shoulder and back pain
    Lifting or dropping the shoulders
    Keeping elbows far from the body
    Frequently reaching for things (especially when bending or twisting of the back is necessary)


Manufacturers
Soldering can be harmful, but not if automated by machines can limit the exposure of it to human factory workers. For instance, dip soldering is an industrial-grade, efficient method of soldering PCBs in bulk. [10]

People that make the parts that computers are composed of are at risk of being negatively affected by these chemicals, toxins, and environment (pun intended), depending on the working conditions that the aforementioned employees are in. [11]
