One problem we encountered:
One of our team members unfortunately was not able to show up to class on two separate occasions. This made it harder to communicate with said teammate and complete what would otherwise have been a higher amount of quality work.



How this problem was solved:
Once this group member returned, the person went straight to work and made up for the tasks they had missed on the days prior. Furthermore, this teammate literally solved problems within our ongoing project. Because our prompted question was of negative connotation, the matters that we dove deep into were of the cons of technology on certain entities and areas. This being said, the individual was tasked with noting down feasible solutions to these problematic issues—something that this classmate accomplished extremely well!

A concern that I have with the team (can include yourself as a team member):
A pending and unaddressed, as of now, concern that I ponder about is how we will be able to effectively communicate with each other and collaborate when parts of this assignment are to be done outside of the class(room) environment.



How I plan on solving this problem:
I’m thinking a group chat on a chatting platform online will enable us to replicate the discussions and feedback that is bounced back and forth between us, as a group, in a physical setting.
