Chosen topic: Universal Basic Income

Research should be boiled down to 2-3 key points in lieu of numerous AI-assisted ideas

It can be said that the people that desire something the most are the ones that such programs/subsidies are tailored to. For instance, the Universal Basic Income proposal has not been put into action yet; such a “liberal fantasy” is mainly directed towards those without jobs or susceptible to losing their jobs, especially in the midst of rising AI automation in the workplace.

The creative medium I would like to use to convey my gathered ideas is through a journal/diary.
